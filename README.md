Unlocking Gold's Secrets: Predicting Price Trends with Python and Random Forest!

# Gold Price Prediction with Random Forest Regressor

This project provides a simple yet powerful Python script for predicting gold prices using a Random Forest Regressor model. Predicting gold prices is of significant interest to investors and traders, and this project aims to provide a practical example of how to perform such predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Import, explore, and preprocess historical gold price data.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze data distribution, correlations, and missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data patterns and relationships using heatmaps and distribution plots.
- **Model Building**: Create and train a Random Forest Regressor model to predict gold prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with the R-squared (R2) score.
- **Visualization**: Compare actual and predicted gold prices in a line plot.
